Useful snippets for WordPress

Over the course of any WordPress project, I find that I need specifc loops and bits over and over. Instead of writing these from scratch, I am compiling them here.

There are many ways to write PHP, but these snippets fit into my style and usage. I will be updating and maintaining this repo as I find new and useful snippets to add!
